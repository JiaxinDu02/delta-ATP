# δ-ATP Dataset: Towards Fast and Reliable Aerial Traffic Patrol

This dataset accompanies the paper: **δ-ATP: Towards Fast and Reliable Aerial Traffic Patrol**  

---

## Overview

The δ-ATP dataset is designed for research in **aerial vehicle speed estimation** and **traffic patrol automation** using drones. It contains:

- High-resolution aerial videos (30 FPS, 4K)
- Ground truth speed captured by radar gun

This dataset enables benchmarking for tasks such as:

- Vehicle detection and tracking
- Speed estimation from overhead views
- Road scene understanding and surveillance
